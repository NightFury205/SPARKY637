## 🧠 Notes

- User data is saved in `mainbank.json` (wallet, bank, inventory).
- Server-specific prefixes are stored in `prefixes.json`.
- `discord.py` is used as the core library — install via pip if not already present.
- Written as a single file for simplicity; can be modularized for large-scale use.

- Daily & weekly reward system
- Inventory upgrades and XP leveling
